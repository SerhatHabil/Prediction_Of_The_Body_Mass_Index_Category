•	There are 6 models benefited in this project. These are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network, SVM, Naïve Bayes and XGBoost, respectively.
•	Accuracy and F1 Score of all are so close to each other. However, random forest is the best model compared to other models because its F1 Score is equal to 1, which means perfect precision and recall.
•	In general, it can be said that the data are very good at predicting BMI. There is no problem with the data.
